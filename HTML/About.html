While I've dabbled in programming and considered opportunities like the BFP, I've come to realize that they might not be the perfect fit for me.

If it turns out that these paths aren’t for me, I’m excited about the possibility of living in Japan, surrounded by a culture I admire and close to my sisters. I believe that life is about trying new things, learning from each experience, and finding where I truly belong."</p>
